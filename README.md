# BBV-Project-Intro
This repository is to host the initial discussion on the best way to build BallotBox.Vote apps for iOS and Android. The simople, easy-to-use apps will be for creating, printing and scaning paper ballots for a ranked choice election - but only for non-government office such as a class president or local civic association officers. The apps will always be free to use, and the entity organizing this educational effort is applying for non-profit status. The founder of this effort has no software experience. Hopefully some experienced developers will volunteer to take the technical leads on this project before too long. For more, please see the Readme.
